## Usage
The workshop instructor will provide you with an event key that you will use during the Setup phase of the workshop, to gain access to an Azure OpenAI custom playground application without requiring you to have an Azure subscription of your own. The event key will be valid only for the duration of the workshop and will require you to complete the workshop within the timeframe for that event.

This workshop is also set up for self-guided learning at home. In this case, you will need to bring your own Azure Subscription (with Azure OpenAI access enabled) or have an active OpenAI subscription, to work on the exercises. You can then use one of the following playground options to try the exercises out at your own pace and schedule.

[Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal) - requires an Azure subscription with Azure OpenAI access enabled.

[OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) - requires a paid OpenAI account for usage.
